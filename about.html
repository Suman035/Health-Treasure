	     <p>Yoga is a spiritual science of self-realisation. It comes from India and goes back over five thousand of years. The Indian sage Pantajali, in his Yoga sutras defines yoga as the control of the activities of the mind. Yoga methods encompass the entire field of our existence, from the physical, emotional and mental to the spiritual. Its methods include ethical disciplines, physical postures, breath control, as well as meditation.
Classical yoga as defined by Patanjali is an eight stages process of spiritual development (the eight limbs of yoga). The first two stages are ethical disciplines (Yamas and Nyamas). Then come postures (Asanas in Sanskrit) and breathing exercises (Pranayama). The last four limbs are meditative stages: control of the sense (Prathyara), concentration (Dharana), meditation (Dhyana) and enlightenment (Samadhi).
Yoga has become a very common term in the Western world today, and yoga classes can be found in virtually every town. Most Westerners identify yoga with hatha yoga.Hatha yoga seeks to promote health and well-being through physical exercise.
 There are plenty of styles of yoga. The most popular are:</p>
 <ul>
<li>Ashtanga Yoga a fast flowing, aerobic yoga workout</li>
<li>Iyengar Yoga strong, precise style of yoga for the fitness conscious</li>
<li>Viniyoga a gentler style with emphasis on healing</li>
<li>Satyananda yoga, a gentle style of traditional Hatha Yoga, suitable for all age and shape.</li>
<li>Bikram Yoga, a dynamic style of yoga, practiced in a heated room.</li>
</ul>

		  <p>Pranayama is breathing exercise which clears the physical and emotional obstacles in our body Through a regular and sustained practice of pranayama you can supercharge your whole body!
</p>
<p>On a physical level by using pranayama techniques we can utilize and strengthen the whole range of our respiratory organs. We explore the lower, middle and upper parts of the breath and regulate the inhalation, retention and exhalation of the breath.</p>
        <p>A regular pranayama practice can stimulate the parasympathetic system, countering the over-stimulation our bodies go through during the fight or flight response.</p>
		<p>Our breathing patterns are also very closely linked to our emotional states. We will breathe in a different way when we are angry, when we are excited, tired or when we are nervous. However, it works the other way too. We can calm or energize ourselves by changing our breathing patterns.  Even by just taking time out to consciously to become more aware of our breath we can help to start to alter our emotional states.</p>

		 <p>Exercise is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle; people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in obesity, weakness, lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development.</p>
		 <ul>
         <li>Regular exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent osteoporosis by building bone strength.</li>
	     <li>Regular fitness can help chronic arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars.</li>
	     <li>Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease stress and anxiety, enhance mood, and improve general mental health.</li> 
	     <li>Regular exercise can help control body weight and in some people cause loss of fat.</li>
		 <li>Thirty minutes of modest exercise (walking is OK) at least 3 to 5 days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week.</li>
		 <li>Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions.</li>
		 <li>Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day.</li>
		 <li>People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise.</li>
		 <li>Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking, swimming, weights, yoga, and many others) is helpful for everybody.</li>
		 <li>Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning.</li>
		 <li>Sports for children may provide excellent opportunities for exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo certain exercises (for example, throwing too many pitches in baseball may harm a joint like the elbow or shoulder).</li>
		 <li>Exertion during strenuous exercise may make a person tired and sore, but if pain occurs, stop the exercise until the pain source is discovered; the person may need to seek medical help and advice about continuation of such exercise.</li>
