	<h1>Tips for self care</h1>
	</br>
	<li><h5 class="adult">Eat healthy foods</h5></li>
	<div class="adult">
	<p>An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Add an array of colors to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes-even fresh herbs-are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.
	</p>
	<p>According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a healthy eating plan:</p>
	<ul class="adult">
	<li>Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products</li>
	<li>Includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts</li>
	<li>Is low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars</li>
	<li>Stays within your daily calorie needs</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	</br>
	<li><h5 class="adult">Stay physically active</h5></li>
	<div class="adult">
	<p>Keeping physically active improves your health and quality of life, and can also help you to live longer. It's never too late to start doing some exercise.
	</p>
	<p><b><i>Health Benefits</i></b></p>
	<p>
	Physical activity means anything from everyday tasks, like cleaning the house, heavy gardening or walking the dog. Or specific exercise like keep fit, swimming, golf, football, gym-based activity or tennis. The best type of activity is one that makes you feel slightly warmer and breathe a bit heavier, getting your heart and pulse pumping faster than usual.
	</p>
	<p>Some of the benefits of keeping active include:
	</p>
	<ul class="adult">
	<li>a reduced risk of developing a life-threatening disease</li>
	<li>a greater likelihood of maintaining or reaching a healthy weight</li>
	<li>a greater sense of well-being</li>
	<li>improved sleep and increased day-time vitality</li>
	<li>stay independent</li>
	<li>have a healthy heart</li>
	<li>reduce falls</li>
	<li>keep up with children you know</li>
	<li>meet people and share the company of others</li>
	<li>feel happier and keep your brain sharp</li>
	<li>age better</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	If you stay physically active, you're also likely to stay independent longer. Exercise can make you stronger. You'll feel more confident and involved in life.

	<li><h5 class="adult">Get regular sleep and rest</h5></li>
	<div class="adult">
	<p>I know I said that self-care wasn't just about bubble baths and getting an early night, but sleep is in fact a crucial part of practicing good self-care.  
	</p>
	<p>
	We're told all our lives that we should be getting a solid 8 hours of sleep per night, but the reality is that at least 40% of Americans are routinely getting far less than 7 hours of sleep.
	</p>
	<p>
	Among the most sleep deprived are adults under 50, parents of young children, and young people in the 18-25 age bracket.
	</p>
	<p>
	When we sleep, our brains are able to rid themselves of the toxins that have accumulated during the day. We are also able to consolidate our memories and build all-important neural highways, which contributes to better brain health and function.
	</p>
	<p>
	We have more energy, are more alert, and are more receptive to learning new skills.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are so many benefits to getting enough sleep, but most of us are still wandering through our days as though we were running on empty.
	</p>
	<p>
	Many of us argue that we are simply too busy to get an early night. However, it's really important to refuel at least once or twice a week.
	</p>
	<p>
	Skirting by on the minimum amount of sleep possible has a negative effect on our immune system and ultimately leaves us vulnerable to infections of all kinds. Not sleeping enough and wondering why you're getting every viral cough and cold that is going around? You're answering your own question.
	</p>
	<p>
	Set aside a couple of nights a week to slow things right down and get to bed early. Avoid looking at your phone, tablet, or even the TV before bed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Instead, have a hot bath or shower, put on your PJs, read a book or magazine, do some puzzles, or play a game.
	</p>
	<p>
	The blue light emitted from devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops actually interrupts our natural circadian rhythm, which is why Harvard researchers suggest going screen-free at least two or three hours before bedtime. Try it and see.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	</br>
	<li><h5 class="adult">Connect socially with friends and family, while maintaining physical distance</h5></li>
	<div class="adult">
	<p>It's really easy to say that we are simply too busy to make time to spend with friends.
	</p>
	<p>Weeks and months go by, and we realize that we haven't really invested in our friendships for a while.
	</p>
	<p>We haven't hung out lately, and though we used to be really close, we don't even know what is happening in our friend's life. Making time for yourself is an important part of self-care, but so is making time to see others.
	</p>
	<p>Schedule a day or evening, once a month, where you meet up with friends and fill each other in on what has happened in the last month. That way, even if you drop the ball on texting or calling in the meantime, you'll know that you can catch up again soon.
	</p>
	<p>It doesn't always have to be drinks or dinner at a fancy restaurant, you could take turns hosting one another. Grab some snacks, order a pizza, or have a potluck dinner. Having a regular event on your calendar will give you something to look forward to.  
	</p>
	<p>This is an especially important part of self-care for those with anxiety or depression, who might avoid interacting with others when they feel down. Meeting up regularly avoids feelings of isolation and loneliness, and can be a welcome distraction from other worries.
